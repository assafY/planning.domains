# planning.domains
### King's College London Final Year Project

The primary objective of the project was building a distributed system running Artificial Intelligence Planning jobs across 60 lab machines, logging each planner's best results across a large set of problem files and domains. The secondary objective was a web app communicating with the server to retrieve the results and display a live leaderboard, that also enables users to upload new planners and problem files to the server.

/web-client/ contains all client and web-backend code (Angular and Node). /src/ contains the Java code for the distributed system and its client machines.
